# code_quiz
* A javascript code quiz

## Game Play

* This quiz is comprised of 5 questions. It is a timed quiz. If you get a question wrong, you lose 10 seconds off the timer. Your score at the end is how many seconds are left. You can submit your initials and this is save to the high scores page.

## Current bugs
 
 * If you click "High Scores" in the Navbar while the timer is going, it doesn't stop the timer. If you leave the High Scores page up, eventually when the timer runs out it will show the "Submit High Score" card on the screen

 * If you click "High Scores" in the Navbar while you are already on the High Scores page, it re-renders the Initials and High Scores, duplicating them.
